If you want to contribute the project, then you must take a look and start a pull request 
that refers to an issue (or more than one). Me (rarely somebody else) will review in. In most
cases you have to explain, what you've done. If everything is ok, then it will be merged.

(When somebody can do a better contributing guideline, then do it :) )
